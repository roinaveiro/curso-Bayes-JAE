# Bayesian inference

* Core problem: approximate posterior distribution.

* Remember: all inference about unknown quantities can be done if we know the posterior.

* Analytic (and exact) calculations just in limited cases.

* We need to **approximate** the posterior. Two methods, so far:

    1. **Simulation-based**: we devise strategies to sample from posterior (MCMC).
    
    2. **Optimization-based**: approximate posterior by tractable density, minimizing some similarity measure (Variational Inference).

# Setting

* General problem

$$
p(\boldsymbol{z},\boldsymbol{x}) = p(\boldsymbol{x} | \boldsymbol{z}) p(\boldsymbol{z})
$$

   
* $\boldsymbol{z}$ are latent variables, $\boldsymbol{x}$ are observation.

* Inference: $p(\boldsymbol{z} | \boldsymbol{x})$.

* MCMC: construct an ergodic Markov chain with stationary distribution $p(\boldsymbol{z} | \boldsymbol{x})$.

* MCMC slow when:

    1. Large amount of data.
    2. Very complex models (many parameters)
    
* Still MCMC comes with guarantees of producing asymptotically exact samples

---

# Why is it so hard?

* The posterior...

$$
p(\boldsymbol{z} | \boldsymbol{x}) = \frac{p(\boldsymbol{z}, \boldsymbol{x})}{p(\boldsymbol{x})}
$$
* ... involves computing the evidence

$$
p(\boldsymbol{x}) = \int p(\boldsymbol{z}, \boldsymbol{x}) d \boldsymbol{z}
$$

* For many models, unavailable in closed form, or requires exponential time.

* Evidence is what we need to compute the posterior from the joint.

# Motivation

* Bayesian mixture of Gaussians (blackboard).

# Variational Inference (on a nutshell)

1. Posit a familiy $\mathcal{Q}$ of (tractable) densities over latent variables.

2. Formulate optimization: find $q(\boldsymbol{z}) \in \mathcal{Q}$ "closer" to real posterior $p(\boldsymbol{z} \vert \boldsymbol{x})$.
$$
q^*(\boldsymbol{z}) = \arg\min_{q(\boldsymbol{z}) \in \mathcal{Q}} \text{KL} (q(\boldsymbol{z}) || p(\boldsymbol{z} \vert \boldsymbol{x}))
$$
3. Solve, and use $q^*(\boldsymbol{z})$ as approximation of posterior.

* Trade-off: $\mathcal{Q}$ rich enough to capture relevant aspects of posterior, but still tractable.

# The ELBO

* Recall that KL is (expectations taken wrt $q(\boldsymbol{z})$)

$$
\text{KL} (q(\boldsymbol{z}) || p(\boldsymbol{z} \vert \boldsymbol{x})) = \mathbb{E}[\log q(\boldsymbol{z})] - \mathbb{E}[\log p(\boldsymbol{z} | \boldsymbol{x})]
$$

* That can be written as

$$
\text{KL} (q(\boldsymbol{z}) || p(\boldsymbol{z} \vert \boldsymbol{x})) = \mathbb{E}[\log q(\boldsymbol{z})] - \mathbb{E}[\log p(\boldsymbol{z} , \boldsymbol{x})] + \log p(\boldsymbol{x})
$$

* Not computable!

* Instead, we minimize an alternative objective

$$
\text{ELBO}(q) = \mathbb{E}[\log p(\boldsymbol{z} , \boldsymbol{x})] - \mathbb{E}[\log q(\boldsymbol{z})]
$$

* Intuition (blackboard)

---

# Mean-field variational inference

* To complete the specification of the problem, we specify $\mathcal{Q}$.

* The mean field approximation works with families such that

$$
q(\boldsymbol{z}) = \prod_{j=1}^m q(z_j)
$$

* Depending on the problem, each *varitional factor* will be parameterized in a particular form.

* In Bayesian mixture of Gaussians

\begin{equation}
q(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \boldsymbol{c}) = \prod_{k=1}^K q(\mu_k; m_k, s^2_k)\prod_{i=1}^n q(c_i; \phi_i)
\end{equation}

# Mean-field variational inference

* Captures marginals, not correlations.

* Same mean but lower variance!!

# CAVI

* Having completely specified inference as an optimization, we propose an algorithm to solve it.

* Coordinate-ascent: iteratively optimize each factor, holding the rest fixed.

* Local-optimum!!

![:scale 100%](./img/cavi.png)

# Derivation

* Blackboard.

* Similarity with Gibbs: gibbs iteratively samples from each variable's complete conditional. 

* CAVI takes the expected log of this conditional and uses it to update.

---
# Praticalities

* ELBO generally non-convex, CAVI guarantees just convergence to local optimum. Multiple re-starts.

* Assess convergence: when the change in ELBO falls below threshold...

* Or use log-predictive distrution in a hold-out dataset (this way we avoid computing ELBO using whole dataset).

* For **conditionally-conjugate** models in the exponential family, the optimization of each coordinate has **closed-form solution**.

# Modern times

* Massive datasets.

* CAVI does not scale...

* ... it requires iterating throuhg the whole dataset at each iteration.

* Alternative: use gradient-based optimization (climb the ELBO by following its gradient).

* But still, computing the gradient requires analyzing the whole dataset...

---

# Stochastic Variational Inference

* Uses two convenient tweaks (to move the variational parameters $\lambda$).

* Instead of gradients, uses **natural gradients**...

* They warp the parameter space such that moving the same distance in different directions amounts to equal change in symmetrized KL divervence.

* Uses the results of **stochastic optimization**.

* Creates noisy (but unbiased) estimates of the full gradient, using a subset (mini-batch) of the data.

$$
\lambda_{t+1} = \lambda_t + \epsilon_t \hat{g}(\lambda_t)
$$

* $\mathbb{E}[\hat{g}(\lambda_t)] = g(\lambda_t)$

---

# Stochastic Variational Inference

* Results from Robbins and Monro (1951) guarantees convergence (to local optimum) under noisy gradients, as long as the step size satisfies

$$
\sum_t \epsilon_t = \infty; \hspace{3cm} \sum_t \epsilon^2_t < \infty.
$$

# Problems (until now)

* We have relied on models with *convenient structure*...

* ...deriving VI algos, requires a lot of model specific analysis.

* For **conditionally conjugate** models in the exponential family, the optmizations in CAVI have closed-form solutions (similarly for SVI).

* In general, the expectations are intractable.

* **Goal**: develop generic VI algorithms that keeps model-specific work to a minimum.

# Black box variational inference

* Idea (using again stochastic optmization):

  1. Write derivative of the objective (ELBO) as an expectation with respect to the variational
approximation.

  2. Sample from the variational approximation to get noisy but unbiased gradients. 
  
  3. Use those gradients to update our parameters. 
---
# Black Box VI

* Recall that

$$\text{ELBO}(q) = \mathbb{E}[\log p(\boldsymbol{z} , \boldsymbol{x})] - \mathbb{E}[\log q(\boldsymbol{z})]$$
* Let's denote parameterized the variational distribution with $\lambda$:

$$
q(\boldsymbol{z}) \rightarrow q(\boldsymbol{z} \vert \lambda)
$$

* We can write the ELBO as

\begin{equation}
\nabla_{\lambda} ELBO = \mathbb{E} \left[\nabla_\lambda \log q(\boldsymbol{z}\vert \lambda) \left( \log p(\boldsymbol{z} , \boldsymbol{x}) - \log q(\boldsymbol{z}) \right)  \right] 
\end{equation}

* Derivation: blackboard.

# Black Box VI

* To evaluate the gradient we need:

  1. Evaluating the joint distribution $\log p(\boldsymbol{z} , \boldsymbol{x})$
  
  2. Evaluating the variational distribution.
  
  3. Evaluating the gradient of the log of the variational distribution.
  
* 2 and 3 does not depend on the specific model!!

* Only assumption about model is that the
practitioner can compute the log of the joint.

* Controlling the variance...

# MCMC in large scale problems

* Big data

  1. Gibbs, pass through all data (and not always usable)
  
  2. MH and HMC both require evaluating likelihood or log-likelihood, pass through al     data.

---
# MCMC in large scale problems

* Recall that we are interested in sampling from the posterior

$$
p(z | x) \propto p(x | z) p(z) = p(z) \prod_{i=1}^N p(x_i \vert z)
$$

* Imagine we just care about the MAP: the value of $z$ with highest posterior density.

* Maximizing posterior is the same as maximizing log-posterior.

* Gradient descent:

\begin{equation}
z_{t+1} = z_t + \epsilon  [\nabla \log p(z) + \sum_{i=1}^N \log p(x_i | z)]
\end{equation}

---
# MCMC in large scale problems

* Stochastic gradient descent: at each time, sample a mini-batch of data $x_{1t}, \dots x_{nt}$

\begin{equation}
z_{t+1} = z_t + \epsilon_t  [\nabla \log p(z_t) + \frac{N}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n \log p(x_{ti} | z_t)]
\end{equation}

* Under Robbins-Monro this converges to MAP...

* ...but we want the full posterior!

---
# Langevin Dynamics

* Take gradient steps, but inject Gaussian noise in the parameter updates so that the do not collapse to MAP
\begin{equation}
\Delta z_t = \frac{\epsilon}{2} \left( \nabla \log p(z_t) + \sum_{i=1}^N \nabla \log p(x_i | z_t)\right) + \eta_t
\end{equation}
where $\eta_t \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \epsilon)$.

* The gradient step sizes and the variances of the injected noise are balanced so that the variance of the samples matches that of the posterior. (Not exact).

* Still we are using the whole dataset in each iteration...

---
# Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics

* Combining both...

\begin{equation}
\Delta z_t = \frac{\epsilon}{2} \left( \nabla \log p(z_t) + \frac{N}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \nabla \log p(x_{ti} | z_t)\right) + \eta_t
\end{equation}
where $\eta_t \sim \mathcal{N} (0, \epsilon_t)$.

* Where $\epsilon_t$ satisfies Robins-Monro

\begin{equation}
\sum_t \epsilon_t = \infty \hspace{2cm} \sum_t \epsilon^2_t < \infty
\end{equation}
